# Tableau Public Visualizations

</details>

## Background

As part of the development of my data analytics skillset and in line with some of the principles of [Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/) I have commited to producing at least one new data visualisation on Wednesday each week. The visualisations will either be bsaed on the work I am currently doing as well as some passion projects or exploration of random datasets. They will generally be created in Tableau Public but occasionally they will be generated in other visualisation softwares or modlues. 

## Examples

Below are the weekly visualisations I have produced to date. 

### [NYC Airbnb]()
